# Layer Wise Relevance Propagation on Graph Convolutional Networks

This is a Graph Convolutional Network Implementation with Layer wise Relevance Propagation on the trained Model To interpret the results of the model

The implementation of Graph Convolutional Network is taken from  
Thomas N. Kipf, Max Welling, [Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907) (ICLR 2017)
